The <strong>Global AI Safety Fellowship (GAISF)</strong> was a large-scale, data-driven fellowship to source and identify the best AI engineers and researchers and get them placed at Frontier AI Safety Research Labs like Anthropic, FAR.AI, UK AISI, and others. We screened more than 50,000 candidates.
